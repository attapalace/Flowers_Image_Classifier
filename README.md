# Flowers_Image_Classifier
Udacity deeplearning learning project to classify images using Tensorflow and Keras

* In This project i used a pretrained Model MobileNet which imported from the tensorflow hub from the link https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/feature_vector/4.
* I loaded the flowers dataset from tensorflow datasets under the name oxford_flowers102, built the model after adding a final layer at the end with the number of flower classes in the dataset.
* Then i trained trained the model and evaluated it for the test dataset.
